To run the second assignment which includes epipolar geometry and chaining 
run in Matlab: chaining with arguments:

chaining(frames_dir, frameStep, ransacMaxIter, ransacThres)

frames_dir : the directory that includes the consequtive frames.

frameStep : How many skipped frames between each iteration, 1 is all frames

ransacMaxIter : maximum number of iteration ransac will do

ransacThres : Cholesky distance to determine inliers and outliers
