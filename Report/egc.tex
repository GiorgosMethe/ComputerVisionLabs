\section{Epipolar Geometry and Chaining}
\label{egc}
In this section we are going to describe the first step of the Structure from Motion algorithm described in Section~\ref{sfm} which is to exploit prior knowledge about the scene. This is done by finding corresponding image points in multiple views, compute their epipolar geometry which is expressed algebraically by the fundamental matrix which can be decomposed to obtain the projection matrices.
